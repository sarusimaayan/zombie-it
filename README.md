## Palo IT Technical Challenge - Zombie Apocalypse
The year is 2025 and the worldwide zombie apocalypse has reached its peak moment in Sydney.
The city is in chaos due to zombies biting and chasing regular citizens on the streets.
This horrendous tragedy has caused all the hospitals within Sydney to become overcrowded, 
people with different diseases and triages have jammed hospital emergency rooms as they wait for their treatments.
Luckily, I developed an application to be used by patients.
The app calculates and display to the patient, the waiting times in different hospitals in Sydney, based on the patient’s level of pain and hospitals average
process times.

## Motivation
The app helps the user make the right decision when choosing hospital, and by that prevents overcrowding in hospitals.
It also collects patient’s name and information about their illness and store it in a local database.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- React.js
- Express
- MongoDB (local)

## Installation
1) Clone the code
2) Intall all the packages with "npm install"

## How to use?
1) Run the app with "npm run start-build"
2) view it on your local host http://localhost:5000/

## Read from DataBase
Open terminal and type the following:
- mongo
- show dbs
- use patientsDB
- db.patients.find()

## Tests
